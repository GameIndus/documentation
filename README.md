Website realized by [@Utarwyn](https://github.com/utarwyn) since 2015 in the project context "GameIndus". This website is a documentation for all services of the GameIndus platform (global usage, editor, engines). Today this documentation has only been  written in French.

We have a very intuitive editor to familiarize the most talented developers and beginners. 
You can create 2d and 3d games from the conception phase to the publishing phase with your team, all of that in real-time!
Projects can be exported to online and desktop platforms and mobile devices.
